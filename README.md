## ðŸ“¸ Portfolio

This is my portfolio, where I aimed to adopt a minimalist design, prioritizing clarity and objectivity. My goal was to include all the functionalities and elements I wanted, without unnecessary excess or distractions. I believe that, in this final version, I have achieved exactly the vision I had in mind for this project. I hope this portfolio can serve as a source of inspiration for others.
